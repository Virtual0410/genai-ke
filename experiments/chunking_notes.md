- Chunking performed at page level (1 chunk per page)
- Chunk IDs follow format: <source>_p<page>_c<index>
- Each chunk currently contains multiple logical sections and subsections
- Document headers, footers, and journal metadata are still present inside chunks
- Sentence boundaries across pages are broken (e.g., “robotics” → “and game AI”)
- No semantic or section-based chunking applied
- Chunk size is large and uneven, risking embedding dilution
- Bullet lists and section headers flattened into paragraph text
- References included in same chunk as conclusion (not isolated)
- Chunks are embedding-ready but not retrieval-optimized
- Future improvement: chunk by section/subsection with overlap to preserve context and improve semantic recall
